## Second week (8.3.24)

Q1}Write a Python program to calculate the product, multiplying all the numbers in a given tuple.

Original Tuple:

(4, 3, 2, 2, -1, 18)

Product - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple: -864

Original Tuple:

(2, 4, 8, 8, 3, 2, 9)

Product - multiplying all the numbers of the said tuple: 27648


Q2}Write a Python program to calculate the average value of the numbers in a given tuple of tuples.

Original Tuple:

((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))

Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples:

[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]

Original Tuple:

((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))

Average value of the numbers of the said tuple of tuples:
[25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
